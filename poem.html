            <p>Six years apart, yet close from the start,<br>
            My cousin sister, you've captured my heart.<br>
            I remember the first time I held you tight,<br>
            A six-year-old boy, in pure delight.</p>
            <p>You were my little companion, my joy every day,<br>
            We'd laugh and we'd play, come what may.<br>
            Your beauty shines, dusky skin and brown eyes,<br>
            Gleaming brightly under sunny skies.</p>
            <p>Small and adorable, with a heart so pure,<br>
            Together, we'd find adventures to explore.<br>
            Though just cousins, you felt like my own,<br>
            In your home, I found my second zone.</p>
            <p>Through holidays spent side by side,<br>
            In your company, I found my pride.<br>
            Misunderstandings and disputes may have come,<br>
            But our bond remains strong, forever one.</p>
            <p>You are my best friend, my sister true,<br>
            And on this special day, I celebrate you.<br>
            Happy 17th birthday, may joy fill your days,<br>
            May your future be bright in countless ways.</p>
